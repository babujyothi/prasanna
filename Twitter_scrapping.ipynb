        "## Twitter Web Scrapping\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Twitter Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Twitter is a goldmine for data analysts due to its real-time nature, diverse user base, and the wide range of topics discussed. Whether it’s tracking the latest trends, understanding public sentiment, or conducting market research, Twitter data can provide valuable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description:\n",
        "This project analyzes tweets from the official Twitter handle of the University of Hyderabad (@HydUniv).\n",
        "The objective is to extract insights, assess public sentiment, and identify key topics discussed in the tweets.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Use Case:\n",
        "Universities, like any public institution, need to understand public perception and engagement on social media.\n",
        "By analyzing the sentiment and topics of tweets, decision-makers can:\n",
        "1. Measure public opinion.\n",
        "2. Identify trending topics and concerns.\n",
        "3. Improve communication strategies based on sentiment and engagement metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement:\n",
        "Social media platforms like Twitter generate massive data, but extracting meaningful insights is challenging due to:\n",
        "1. Large volumes of unstructured text data.\n",
        "2. The need for real-time sentiment and topic analysis.\n",
        "3. Lack of tools to identify trends and public sentiment effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Solution:\n",
        "This project uses Python and relevant libraries to:\n",
        "1. Fetch tweets using the Twitter API.\n",
        "2. Perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob.\n",
        "3. Categorize tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.\n",
        "4. Conduct topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover underlying themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps in the Project:\n",
        "1. Data Collection\n",
        "2. Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "3. Topic Modeling\n"
